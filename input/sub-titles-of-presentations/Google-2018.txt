The Pixel

can't stop leaking.

- We pretty much know

everything there is to know

about a Pixel 3, as

well as the Pixel 3 XL.

- We have a very clear

image now of this Pixel 3.

- We know pretty much everything about it.

- No matter how hard you try,

you literally can't get

anything past the internet.

- Good morning, everyone!

I'm so glad you've joined us.

We're shaking things up a

little bit with a new venue,

some new faces in a new city.

Special welcome to our

friends in the media.

We've also invited some of

our top sales associates

from Verizon and TELUS.

Welcome.

Yeah, that's right.

For you out-of-towners,

thanks so much for coming here

to New York city to be with us.

So this year marks

Google's 20th anniversary,

and for two decades, we've been

working towards our mission

of helping to organize

the world's information,

make it more accessible

and helpful for everybody.

Delivering information has

always been in our DNA.

It's why we exist.

We love working on really hard problems

that make life easier for people

in big and small ways.

And I wanted to tell you a couple stories

about what I mean about this.

So even after two decades,

we're constantly working

to shave as many milliseconds as possible

off of our search times.

That focus has caused us to

push into a bunch of new areas.

We designed our own servers.

We designed an operating

system to run our data centers.

All this so you could find

search results faster.

But if we're really gonna help

people, we need to make sure

we provide the most

relevant search results.

And we can only do that

if we know what people are asking for.

So we set out to understand

the nuances of language

and the intent behind the words.

As we progressed on that, we

realized that we could help

with translation, too.

That's led us down a path of developing

completely new technologies,

software, hardware,

and the AI that underlies it all.

And now, we're translating

143 billion words

every day in more than 100 languages.

And now more people can

say what they wanna say

to each other.

Beautiful, hello, thank you.

These are three of the

most requested words

in every language.

And with speech recognition

as good as it is,

we can roll out voice interactions

across our hardware

devices so your devices

understand you when you talk to them.

We can lessen the pain

of responding to emails

by suggesting quick responses.

And Smart Compose in Gmail even offers

to finish your sentences as you type.

It can suggest relevant contextual phrases

and cut back

on repetitive typing like addresses.

Smart Compose is already saving people

a billion characters of typing each week

and it's coming to

mobile first with Pixel.

So with our improvements in language,

the Google Assistant is much better

at getting things done for you

like booking a restaurant

reservation over the phone.

That's our Duplex technology

you saw earlier this year.

These incredible technologies

you'll hear about today

are built on this 20-year

history of making information

more accessible and helpful for people.

This is also true of our work in imaging.

Many of you in this room

say last year's Pixel 2

still takes the best

pictures even in a year

with so many amazing flagship phones.

That's not a fluke.

Pixel's camera completely

rethinks how images are captured

and we can trace that intelligence

directly back to Google Search.

We noticed very early on

that people were using Google

to search for images

even though our results

weren't perfect back then

because we were looking at meta tags,

we were looking at surrounding text.

Now it's just really a work-around.

But what we really needed to do

was look at the images themselves.

So we spent years researching

computer vision technologies,

analyzing hundreds of millions of photos,

and now we're getting better all the time

at recognizing objects and

faces and even concepts

within an image or a scene.

And we have all kinds of

ways to put this technology

to work for you.

Like right now, you can search

through your photo library

so pictures are accessible

wherever you are

without any work from you.

And we can help take a

stunning portrait photo

just like you would with a DSLR.

And we can smooth out

shakiness in your videos.

You can also point your

camera at a movie poster,

get local theater listings,

maybe even look up an actor's bio.

And we've invented a new type of camera,

put it on a fleet of cars,

and then drove those cars

all over the world to give you

a detailed map of the world.

So from searching to translating

to getting a great photo of the world,

when we see an opportunity to help people,

we go the extra mile.

Our deep investment in AI over many years

is at the core of our

ability to push forward

in many areas at once.

And you're gonna see this in

a lot of our products today.

I say this every year,

but the big breakthroughs

you're gonna see are

not in hardware alone.

They come at the

intersection of AI, software,

and hardware working together.

This approach is what makes

Google's hardware experience

so unique and it unlocks all

kinds of helpful benefits.

When we think about

artificial intelligence

in a consumer hardware context,

it isn't artificial at all.

It's helping you get real

things done every day.

A shorter route to work,

a gorgeous vacation photo,

a more efficient home.

Our guiding principle

here is exactly the same

as it's been for 20 years,

to respect our users

and to put them first.

And that guides our work in

three very specific ways.

First, we wanna respect

each user as an individual

and provide them with

their own personal Google.

Just as Google is organizing

the world's information,

we can combine AI, software, and hardware

to organize your information.

Your experience and

the help we provide you

is unique to you.

The Google Assistant is

the best expression of this

and it's always available

to help provide help

when and where you need it.

Second, we're committed to

the security of our users.

We need to offer simple, powerful ways

to safeguard your devices.

One way we do this is at the OS level.

Google Play Protect is

the most widely deployed

mobile threat protection

service in the world

and it constantly works in the background

to keep your devices and data safe.

We've also integrated Titan Security,

the system we built for

Google data centers,

into our mobile devices

with a new dedicated chip.

Titan Security protects your

most sensitive on-device data

by securing your lock screen

and strengthening disk encryption.

And it also even protects the integrity

of the operating system itself.

By combining Titan Security

both in the data center

and on-device, we've created a closed loop

for your data across the Google ecosystem.

We know people wanna hear a lot about this

so you'll be hearing more

about it throughout the day.

A vital third theme of

ours, we wanna make sure

that you're in control of

your digital well-being.

From our research, 72%

of users are concerned

about the amount of time

they spend using tech.

And we absolutely share that concern.

So we've developed new

tools that let you control

your devices, instead of

those devices controlling you.

We're introducing new

simple ways to cut down

on notifications and distractions.

We can help you understand

the amount of time

you're spending with

different applications

and set app limits so

you can switch them off

when you want to.

And we're providing parents

with simple controls

over screen time with the family.

We feel a deep responsibility to our users

to provide a helpful,

personal Google experience

while keeping their information secure

and making sure they're in control

of their digital well-being.

These things really matter to our users

and it shows in their

response to our products.

The enthusiasm has been

absolutely great this year.

Our Google Home devices are expanding

into more countries and more homes.

Our daily active users have grown by 5X

in the past year alone, and

test after test concludes

that Google Home is the most accurate

and most helpful home assistant device.

It does the best job of

filtering out background noises

and understanding

different people's voices,

and it now offers help

in multilingual homes.

Pixelbook has had a huge year as well.

The Verge said Pixelbook is stellar.

It's elegant, sturdy,

fast, and smartly designed.

And both Pixelbook owners and

a lot of you tech reviewers,

gave it the edge over

other premium laptops

for its speedy performance

and innovative design.

And we're just getting started here.

And what a year for Pixel 2.

A couple months ago, Wired named it

the best smartphone money can buy in 2018.

That's as good as it

gets especially in a year

with so many great flagship phones.

Plus, the Pixel experience

keeps getting better over time

as we've rolled out a

number of helpful updates.

The UI is improved, the colors are deeper.

The phone is just all around more helpful

than when it first came out.

We're really proud of

the progress we've made

across the whole Made by Google family,

but you probably don't

wanna hear too much more

about last year's products,

so let's talk about what

we've been working on.

So first, for life on the go, we designed

the world's best camera and put it

in the world's most helpful phone.

Introducing the beautiful new Pixel 3.

And for life at home, we

designed - oops, sorry,

for life at work and

at play, we're bringing

the power and productivity of a desktop

to a gorgeous tablet called Pixel Slate.

And for life at home, we

designed a smart display

so you can hear and see the info you need

and manage your connected

home from a single screen.

Introducing Google Home Hub.

And here they are, coming

up here in the pedestals,

for the first time, seen in real life.

Go ahead, you can take a

couple photos if you'd like.

- Try not to knock 'em

over because if you break it,

you have to buy it.

- Give you about 30 seconds or so.

- I gotta get a shot of these.

These look great.

- Wow!

- Okay, all right, we can

start to put 'em away.

Don't worry, everyone, you'll

get more time with them

in the demo area.

Are you trying to take one outta there?

I would, too.

- But please don't.

I think they look great.

They look great, right?

- Yeah.

- Well, let's talk about the design,

because I think the design

of this year's products

are absolutely terrific.

Just last month, Fast Company named Google

the design company of the year

for our efforts in both

hardware and software design.

We've seen incredible

progress in material design,

our adaptable open-source

system of guidelines,

tools, and components that

support the best practices

of user interface design.

And this has resulted in some

truly beautiful evolutions

of the applications you know and love.

And this year's new devices fit perfectly

with the rest of the family.

That's due to the amazing Ivy Ross

and her wonderful design team.

They've really, yes!

They've really pushed us to

think about how technology

can be designed for

the way you live today.

And the design world has taken notice.

Over the past year,

Made by Google products

have won more than 45 of the

design industry's top awards.

Ivy's gonna give us a rare

peek into her design studio

and share some of the details

about her team's philosophy and approach.

Let's take a look.

- People think aesthetics

is making something pretty

and it's really not.

I mean, aesthetics is

about igniting our senses.

I think we're all craving

that a little bit.

What is the design language for Google?

Bold and optimistic.

Human in our forms and in

our colors and in our shapes.

As technology progresses,

it needs to be closer to us.

Soft circles and curves

evoke something natural and familiar.

How that language shows

up will evolve over time.

I think technology has to fit into place.

It will eventually be invisible.

The design challenge is

to make that transition

smooth and beautiful.

Our job is to figure

out what it feels like

to hold Google in your hand.

- So cool, so cool.

Some of the best examples

of the amazing work

that Ivy and her team have been doing

is in the most important

place in your life, your home.

Fast Company named Google Home Mini

the most innovative

product design of 2018.

And consumers love it, too,

as it extends access to the Assistant

in more places throughout the home.

With Google WiFi, we're

using mesh networking and AI

to extend your home WiFi network.

Google WiFi is still the number one router

and it's the simplest way to make sure

that your connection speed is good

and your home network is well managed.

You might have heard that

we're bringing together

Google and Nest so we

can solve deeper problems

in managing people's homes.

The right way to do this is

to start with the basics.

The smart home of 2018 is too complex

with siloed technologies and interfaces.

Your smart home really

doesn't seem too smart

when it can't figure out

how to turn on the lights

or set your home security system.

So together with Nest, we're

pursuing our shared vision

of a thoughtful home

that isn't just smart,

but it's helpful and

simple enough for everyone

to set up and use.

Nest defined the thoughtful home

with the Nest Learning Thermostat

which is the number one

product in its space

and it's helped save

over 25 billion kilowatt hours of energy.

Nest also has the top-rated products

in connected security cameras,

smoke alarms, and door bells.

So working together,

Google and Nest can shape

how these technologies come together

for a more helpful, thoughtful home.

To show you what that

means, let me bring Diya out

to talk a little bit more

about the newest addition

to the Google Home family.

Diya?

- Thanks, Rick.

Hey, everyone!

Thanks so much for being here today.

Let me tell you about

how we have re-imagined

Google for the home.

Two years ago, we launched Google Home

with the goal of helping

you and your family simplify

the hectic moments in your life

and we've seen that this is

striking a chord with our users.

The number of queries in

Google Home has gone up

by over 400% in just the last year.

But now, imagine not only being

able to hear a response back

when you ask Google Assistant a question,

but imagine being able

to see a response back.

That is the power of Google Home Hub.

With Google Home Hub, we've redesigned

Google's most helpful services,

like Search, YouTube,

Maps, Calendar, and Photos,

so they're easily

controllable with your voice,

and provide glanceable help.

Today, all of us use many

different display devices

in our homes, like phones,

laptops, and even tablets.

But none of these were

developed with the goal

of helping you and your family

in your home environment.

That is why we built Google Home Hub.

We obsessed about what a display

designed specifically

for your home should do.

How should it interact

with you and your family?

What kind of help should it provide?

How should it look in any room?

So we spent countless

hours on the design of Hub.

We incorporated soft, rounded

corners and premium materials,

including our own custom fabrics.

You can also choose from

four beautiful colors

to complement any room.

The elegant floating display is big enough

so that you can see things

even from across the room,

but it's small enough to fit

in any space in your home.

We also consciously did

not put a camera on Hub

so that it was comfortable

to use in the private spaces

of your home like your bedroom.

We wanted to make sure that Hub

is not a bright, glowing

screen in your home.

So we made sure that Hub

can respond automatically

to the ambient light in the room.

To do this, we developed a

feature called Ambient EQ.

With Ambient EQ, we

take a dedicated sensor

and combine it with our

own imaging algorithms

so that we can fine-tune the brightness

and color of the display.

So now, Hub can respond automatically

to the bright white tones of natural light

that you get during the day,

and then gradually shift

into the oranges and yellows

of your indoor lights

in the evening.

You can feel the magic of Ambient EQ

when you look at your photos on a Hub.

And, of course, Hub automatically

turns the screen off at night.

So now, no matter what

time of day, which room,

and even your home decor,

Hub can blend seamlessly

into your home.

Finally, we also wanted Hub

to be a communal device,

one that works for everyone in your home.

So we trained Hub

on Google's industry-leading

speech recognition technology.

By using Voice Match,

Hub is able to recognize

who is speaking to it

and it's able to provide

a personalized experience

for each and every user

in your home.

Today, 85% of Google Home

users are using Voice Match.

So by now, you're probably

wondering how Hub works.

So let me call up Mark,

one of our project managers

to show you Hub in action.

- Thanks, Diya.

Hello, everyone.

I'm excited to share

with you a few examples

how Hub fits into my home.

Mornings are crazy for most of us,

and having a little bit

of help would be awesome.

With Hub, I can just say, hey, Google.

Good morning.

- Good morning, Mark.

The time is 9:00 a.m.

Currently in San Francisco,

it's 64 and sunny.

The best way to get to work by car

is via US 101 South and

will take 45 minutes.

There are 11 entries in your calendar.

By the way, remember to pick

up eggs for dinner tonight.

- Because Hub recognized my

voice, it tells me everything

I need to know while I'm

finishing up my cup of coffee.

And in the evenings, Hub is great

at helping me make dinner and relax.

Google Home Hub is the best

display made for the kitchen.

So instead of fumbling

around with your phone

or the tablet while you

have flour on your hands

or you're washing dishes

or wearing oven mitts,

you can simply use your voice

to get help in the kitchen.

You can set multiple timers.

You can find out how

many ounces are in a cup.

You can even figure out what

to cook for dinner tonight.

My Hub gives me access to

a huge library of recipes

including great dishes from Tasty.

Tonight, I'm gonna make

two of the classics,

eggs Benedict with The French 75,

#latenightbrunch.

As you can see, with

Hub I can follow along

step-by-step instructions to figure out

how to make eggs Benedict.

I can even watch a video to

figure out how to poach an egg.

Now I'd like to tell you a little bit more

about YouTube on Hub.

The YouTube experience has been optimized

so I have access to a ton of how-to videos

just by using my voice.

Good example is I can say, hey, Google.

YouTube video?

Now Hub, hey, Google, show me

how to carve a pumpkin.

- Okay.

Showing how to carve

Halloween pumpkins on YouTube.

- That's a pretty epic pumpkin.

And, of course, Hub is great

for enjoying music as well.

With YouTube music, you can

easily find the perfect song,

video or artist.

Hey, Google.

Play something brand new.

- All right, here's

some music on YouTube.

- All I have to do is ask

to have instant access

to the massive catalog

of music and videos.

By offering the ability

to hear and see your music

on Hub, it really brings the

concert right to your home.

Through December, Hub comes

with six months of YouTube Premium on us

including ad-free videos

and our new YouTube

Music streaming service.

So we all know technology

can make our lives easier

and more fun.

But sometimes it's

really hard to disconnect

and enjoy time with friends and family.

Hub can help with that, too.

Just put Hub into Downtime mode,

and it won't interact

with anyone in the house

except for those critical

things like alarms.

It's a simple step but it

makes a huge difference.

We're also introducing a set of tools

to provide parents with a

little bit of peace of mind.

With filters, you can ensure

that everyone in the home

is enjoying family-friendly content.

So no matter if you're

starting off your day,

if you're learning something new,

or if you're just chilling at

home, Hub is there to help.

Back to you, Diya.

- Thanks a lot, Mark.

As you can see, Hub can really

help you simplify your home.

But there's more.

As Rick mentioned, we wanna

build a thoughtful home

for our users, and where

this comes to life the most

is in how easy it is with

Hub to set up, manage,

and control your devices.

You can even see the state of

your entire home at a glance.

It truly is a hub for

your thoughtful home.

So let me show you how.

Today I have a few different

smart devices in my home.

Smart lights, thermostat, doorbell,

and even a door lock.

To be able to control

and manage these devices,

I have to go to multiple different apps.

And if my husband wants to

manage and control these devices,

he has to go to the same apps.

We have no one place to go to

to get the state of our entire home.

Did we forget to turn down

the lights and lock the door

in the living room before going to bed?

With Hub, we're introducing Home View.

With a swipe down from

the top of the screen,

you can bring up a simple dashboard.

The dashboard shows you the

state of your entire home

at a quick glance and

provides you quick access

to all your devices.

This has been a radically

helpful addition to my home.

Home View was designed to be super easy

and intuitive to use with a

simple tap or with your voice.

You can even see things by room

so you can turn down the

temperature in the bedroom

and turn up the music in the living room.

It's now all in one place

for the very first time

and easily accessible by

everyone in your family.

And we're providing the

same level of control,

even if you're not near your Hub.

We have redesigned the Google Home app

to be the mobile controller

for your smart home.

It has the same Home

View dashboard as Hub.

So now you can control all your devices

from any phone even

when you're not at home.

Now, with Nest devices, we

have all the tools in place

to help take the experience

of a thoughtful home

to the very next level.

So we made sure that Hub

was deeply integrated

with Nest devices, like Nest

Camera, Nest Thermostat,

and even Hello doorbell.

So, for instance, if you're having dinner

and someone happens to ring your doorbell,

Hub will automatically show

you who's at the front door,

and you can tap a quick

response or use your voice

to let your guest know

that you'll be right there.

Many people have connected

devices in their homes today

and they don't even know it.

Hub can help with that.

Home View lets you control

over 200 million devices

from over a thousand brands,

many of them in your home today.

So now, with a simple

tap or with your voice,

you can control your Dish

Hopper DVR, your Chromecast,

your Vizio TV and even your

Philips Hue light bulb.

With Home View you have all

the tools in place to help you

build and manage your thoughtful home,

whether you have a house full

of connected devices like I do

or you're just getting started

with your first simple smart light bulb.

Now, we've talked a lot

about what Hub can do.

But what about when it's not in use?

We designed Hub to be the

world's best photo frame

so that you could relive

your precious moments

on Google Home Hub.

We do this via a deep

integration with Google Photos.

Google Photos has over 1.2

billion photos and videos

uploaded every single day.

So now you can select any

album that you've ever created

or that was shared with you.

And, we're introducing a new

feature called Live Albums.

With Live Albums, you can just

select the photos of people

that you want to see, and

what we will automatically do

is create a new album with all the photos

you've ever taken of those people.

Your photos also never get stale

because Live Album updates automatically

every time you take new pictures.

So it's been really amazing.

Every time I walk by Hub

and see a photo of my son

or husband that I've forgotten about,

it brings a smile to my face.

And we recently came home

from a family vacation

to show our photos

already displaying on Hub.

Hub also makes a perfect, Hub

also makes it easy to share

Live Albums with loved ones.

So now my parents can see

photos of my son show up

automatically in their home.

Now, you also might be wondering,

what about that blurry

picture I took the other day?

Will that show up on Hub as well?

The answer is no.

We use machine learning to only show

your best photos on Hub.

We automatically filter out blurry photos,

under-exposed photos, those

random pictures of things

like receipts, and even duplicate photos.

Now, with Google Home

Hub, you have a great way

to actually relive your favorite memories.

So you can pre-order Google Home Hub

on the Google Store today for $149,

and it's also available on October 22nd

at retail locations here in

the US, UK, and Australia.

Google Home Hub is the perfect display

to help you manage your thoughtful home

and provide the help

you need with a glance.

Check out this video.

Thank you.

- Woo!

All right!

All right!

As I mentioned earlier,

Google's been obsessed

with speed and relevance

of the search information

we can provide.

We built this incredible search engine,

but back then, browsers

were just too slow.

So then we built Chrome,

a faster, more secure browser.

But users still had to

use our fast browser

on their old, slow PCs.

They took way too long to start up,

they were a hassle to keep secure,

and they just weren't optimized

for the web and app

experiences we use today.

And we knew computing could

be fundamentally better,

so we developed Chrome OS

to represent a new vision

for computing based on

our core tenets of speed,

simplicity, and security.

Chrome OS brings together

the best of Google,

Search, AI, and apps and

services all in one place.

Now your Chromebook boots

up in seconds, not minutes.

It lasts all day.

And it gets better over time.

It keeps up with the

many aspects of your life

because work and play are

fluid throughout the day.

And that's why millions of

people have used these devices

in schools, homes, and

businesses worldwide.

Last year, Chrome OS

took a big step forward

with the introduction of apps

from the Google Play Store

and also with the

introduction of helpfulness

from the Google Assistant.

We tied this all together

with the launch of Pixelbook,

the high-performance Chromebook.

Pixelbook reviews from both

the press and customers

have been fantastic.

People especially love its

beautiful, versatile design

and its blazing fast speed.

And today we're sharing a new chapter

for our vision for Chrome OS

with the launch of Google Pixel Slate.

Here's Trond to tell you a

little bit more about it.

- Thanks, Rick.

Google Pixel Slate is a

completely new experience,

giving you powerful productivity

in a fresh, mobile form

something that isn't a

laptop trying to be a tablet

because who wants a fan in their tablet?

Or a tablet that's really a phone

pretending to be a computer.

Instead, we combined the helpful elements

of all of these devices to create

a modern computing experience

people have been asking for.

We designed Pixel Slate

to be both thin and light.

It's crafted with beautiful

lines and rounded edges

in a stylish midnight blue.

And it has a perfectly

balanced center of gravity

so it's incredibly comfortable to hold.

Pixel Slate is engineered with

a stunning detailed display,

so sitting back to enjoy a

movie is better than ever.

It has 293 pixels per inch.

That's 6 million pixels,

for the sharpest picture

in the category.

When we put Pixel Slate in the hands

of some of our most

demanding YouTube creators,

filmmakers, who make movies in 8K,

they raved about this display.

Let's take a look at how they reacted

to seeing their content on

Pixel Slate for the first time.

- We're looking for something

that draws us in personally,

that excites us.

- As a creator, I

spend a lot of time trying

to just make sure our image

looks the best it can be.

To see the Pixel Slate

representing that correctly

is really awesome.

- It's like

you're taking the glass

out of the window.

- That's exactly

how it's supposed to look.

- To get to this level of quality,

Pixel Slate uses a custom display

with low-temperature

polycrystalline silicon technology

which allows for a hundred

times faster movement

of electrons versus a standard display.

As a result, it can efficiently light up

a massive number of pixels.

Your movies, photos, and

games will be stunning

in vibrant colors and

brilliant resolution.

Now, a brilliant display doesn't mean much

without great sound.

So with Pixel Slate, we've

positioned the speakers

on the front of the device so

they can direct stereo sound

towards you instead of out

towards the walls or the floor.

They deliver surprisingly big sound.

- We've also tuned our audio algorithms

with a custom-designed

profile that gives you

crisp highs and clear lows.

This combination of an amazing display

and dual front-firing speakers

gives you the best

entertainment experience

you can hold in your hands.

It's also a great device for cord-cutters,

and nothing brings this to

life better than YouTube TV.

We're excited to give you

three months of YouTube TV

with the purchase of a new

Pixel Slate or Pixelbook

so you get live TV from

more than 60 networks

including sports and local news.

- Took his time today.

The heat get off to join--

- Now, you heard Rick talk

earlier about our deep history

in imaging and computational photography.

We're bringing some of that

same innovative engineering

to Pixel Slate's eight

mega-pixel front-facing

and rear-facing cameras.

Both cameras incorporate our

machine learning algorithms

so you can take great photos

including Portrait mode.

We've also designed

the front-facing camera

to be perfect for video chat.

It has a wide-angle lens

so you can fit everyone

in the frame and a

sensor with larger pixels

which allows for excellent

low-light performance.

Pixel Slate represents a

new chapter for Chrome OS.

Let me show you how we've re-imagined it

for this type of device.

The UI is now optimized to

be simple and easy to use

on a touch screen.

It's a Chrome OS experience that's meant

to be held in your hands.

And at the same time, it gives you

a full desktop experience,

not one designed for a phone.

You can work the way that

you're used to working.

You can even run developer tools

and full-powered Linux applications.

Check out the re-configured launcher.

Instead of hunting for the app you need,

machine learning customizes

the launcher just for you,

suggesting the apps that

you're most likely looking for.

It's your own personal Google

right at your fingertips.

You can easily multitask with

features like split screen

which lets you seamlessly

shift between work and play.

And now, with Pixel Slate,

the Google Assistant

is even more deeply

integrated within Chrome OS.

Simply use your voice and the

Assistant can help you find

a restaurant, dictate an email,

or play your favorite show.

Another helpful feature is Family Link.

This helps you set digital

ground rules for your family

and gives you more control

over how and when your devices are used.

And when it's time to

settle in for the night,

our new do not disturb

and night light features

help you tune out

distractions and gently adjust

the color temperature of your

display to help you wind down.

Now, as you'd expect from us, Pixel Slate

provides really powerful,

hassle-free security.

Virus protection is built in.

The OS updates in the background,

so you always have the

latest security and features

without any annoying interruptions.

Pixel Slate also includes

a Titan Security chip,

so your information, device

passwords, and operating system

are protected on your device.

And to eliminate the fuss

of typing your password,

Pixel Slate's power button

doubles as a fingerprint sensor,

so you can unlock it just

as quickly and securely

as you do your Pixel phone.

Just touch the top and you're good to go.

All of these amazing new

experiences on Chrome OS

truly make Pixel Slate a perfect device

for play and work.

But a true desktop experience

demands a great keyboard.

So we created the Pixel Slate Keyboard,

the perfect companion to Pixel Slate.

The keyboard connects to

Pixel Slate in a snap.

No pairing or charging needed.

Just connect it and start typing.

You'll love the way the

Pixel Slate Keyboard feels.

Last year, TechCrunch said Pixelbook

has the most satisfying

keyboard to type on

I've ever experienced.

So we took everything

great about that keyboard

and put it in a folio.

Its full-size, backlit keyboard

is incredibly comfortable to type on.

The rounded hush keys are soft and quiet

so you won't be that person

with the loud, clackity keyboard.

And the full-featured trackpad

works just like you're used to.

The folio is infinitely adjustable

so you can comfortably use

it at any angle you'd like.

Use it at your desk, on a

plane, or at your kitchen table.

And when you're done with work,

it turns into a slim protective case

that you can take anywhere.

Whether you're using Pixel Slate

with or without the keyboard,

there's a universe of

apps to help you do more.

G Suite is amazing on Pixel Slate.

Our powerful productivity tools are used

by more than a billion people worldwide.

And people spend an

incredible 74% of their time

in these apps working together.

With Docs, Sheets, and

Slides you can collaborate

and create like never before.

Pixel Slate also uses the

full desktop Chrome browser

so you'll never be limited by

the mobile version of a site.

And you can take complete advantage

of the rich ecosystem of extensions

and open as many tabs as

you need to get work done.

There are also millions of

apps in the Google Play Store,

from productivity to fitness,

to games, and entertainment.

We're continuing to

work closely with Adobe

and are pleased to launch

the all-new Adobe Acrobat

on Pixel Slate.

It's a great example of how developers

are optimizing their apps for Chrome OS.

It lets you edit PDFs with precision,

quickly fill out forms, and

sign and annotate documents

using the Pixelbook Pen.

We also have new apps launching

focused on helping you stay healthy.

One that I'm really

excited about is Peloton

because it'll help me

keep up with my workout

even when I'm away from my bike.

And when it's time to relax,

enjoy your favorite shows

on Netflix or experience

millions of worlds with Roblox.

So that's Pixel Slate,

powered by the re-imagined Chrome OS.

It's designed to be as

versatile as you are,

with a desktop operating system,

a full keyboard and trackpad,

a brilliant display and the

mobility and app support

of a tablet.

Pixel Slate comes in

several configurations

starting at $599.

Pixel Slate Keyboard is

$199 and Pixelbook Pen,

now in matching midnight blue, is $99.

All three will be

available later this year

on the Google Store and at major retailers

in the US, Canada, and the UK.

Pixel Slate is truly a no-compromise way

to work and play.

Let's take one final

look at it before I go.

- Finally, it's time to talk about phones!

Google Pixel 3 is designed

from the inside out

to be the smartest, most

useful device in your life.

It's a phone that can answer itself,

a camera that won't miss a shot,

and adds a whole new

experience when it's charging.

- Pixel 3 was built

with exceptionally beautiful

and thoughtful design choices.

It feels great to the touch

and light in your hand.

The matte finish on the all-glass back

is the first of its kind.

It carries over our iconic two-tone design

while providing a beautiful, silky texture

that helps avoid fingerprints.

We developed a new etching process

that allows for both

matte and glossy textures

on the same piece of curved glass

with smooth lines and

seamless transitions.

Pixel 3 comes in three colors:

Just Black, Clearly White,

and a new color, which is not pink.

- The new Pixel comes

in two display sizes,

the 5 1/2-inch Pixel 3 and

the 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL.

Both of them share the same features

but we know users who want a bigger phone

really want a bigger screen.

So we've designed Pixel

3 XL's screen to extend

all the way to the upper corners,

giving users an edge-to-edge

viewing experience

with some extra useful space at the top.

The flexible OLED is the

best Pixel display ever.

The new adaptive color profile provides

a bright, vibrant viewing experience

from any angle and in any lighting.

Both phones have bigger

screens than last year's Pixel

and a larger screen-to-body ratio.

They feel smaller and

more comfortable to hold.

- Our front-firing stereo

speakers are 40% louder and richer

than last year, perfect for a video call

or for playing music by the pool.

The custom sound profile

was developed for Pixel 3

by a Grammy-winning music producer

for stunning volume and clarity.

To get the most out of this

incredible audio experience,

Pixel 3 is the first phone that ships

with a new YouTube music

streaming experience

and we're giving it to Pixel owners

on us for six months.

Between the design, the display,

and the powerful speakers,

you'll love how Pixel 3 looks and sounds.

- Everyone raves about the Pixel camera

and today, the smartest camera

gets even better with the Pixel 3.

It's so good, even

professional photographers

are shooting with it.

We're excited to announce

a new partnership

with one of the most

celebrated photographers

of our time, Annie Leibovitz.

For her latest project,

she's using Pixel 3

to take photos as she

travels around the country

capturing portraits of

inspiring people and places.

It's the first time that

Annie has officially partnered

with any camera and we can't

wait to unveil the series.

- Now, it's no accident

that Pixel's camera

is ahead of the curve.

It's a true end-to-end combination

of our AI, software, and hardware.

We're building on Google's deep expertise

in computational photography.

Perhaps the most obvious way

it comes to life is with HDR+.

When we introduced zero shutter lag HDR+

on the first Pixel, it blew

away traditional HDR methods

and we're still the only

ones to use this method.

When you press the shutter, Pixel captures

a burst of several short exposures.

We combine the images

algorithmically to create an image

that is brighter, more

detailed, and more colorful.

This technology is generations ahead

of other smartphones

and all of this is happening on-device.

Pixel Visual Core is our

custom-designed imaging chip

that takes complex imaging

and data crunching power

out of our data centers

and puts it on your phone.

We built Pixel Visual Core into Pixel 3

making the camera even faster and smarter

to power new computationally

intensive features.

- No matter how great your camera

is at capturing the finest details

and reproducing the

colors, you can still miss

the perfect shot if you

don't hit the shutter

at exactly the right moment.

Top Shot solves that problem.

Let's check it out.

- All right, come on, girls.

Get together.

Three, two, one.

- Oh!

- I wasn't ready!

- Ready?

- Go, go, go!

- Sorry, bro!

- Ooh, let's get a group photo.

- Ready?

- Oh!

- Oh, no.

- Oh you did not get that.

- One, two, three, cheese!

- Pixel 3's camera is smart enough to know

a good photo when it sees it.

Our machine learning is trained

by analyzing millions of images.

So it know you want to see

smiles instead of sneezes,

photos where everyone in the

group has their eyes open,

and the perfect moment of

shock at a surprise party.

Top Shot automatically captures

alternate shots in HDR+

so if your timing wasn't

perfect, it'll suggest

a better one.

You can also scroll through the alternates

and save one of those instead.

- And then there's Super Res Zoom.

Anyone who's tried to

take a photo at a concert

knows that phone cameras

have terrible zoom.

Instead of shooting a

grainy photo, Pixel 3 shoots

a burst of photos, each a bit different,

taking advantage of the natural

tiny movements of your hand.

And you can guess what happens next.

We run the variations

through a merging algorithm

to create a beautiful, zoomed-in shot,

so you can get closer to the

details and frame your shot

the way you want.

This technique of merging

slightly different photos

for higher resolution has been used

in advanced astronomy research

to surface the image of Mars,

to image the surface of Mars.

Pixel 3 puts this technology into a device

you can hold in your hand.

- Another feature that

we're really excited about

is Night Sight.

Life's best moments aren't

always perfectly lit.

A party, a campfire with your friends,

one last shot before the bar closes.

The typical solution

for low-light settings

is the flash, which makes a big scene,

blinds your friends, and leaves you

with an unnatural-looking photo

with uneven exposures and shadows.

Night Sight works so well

you'll never use your flash again.

Let's take a look.

In extreme low light, we

turn to machine learning

to choose the right colors

based on the content of the image.

These shots are completely untouched.

Night Sight makes Pixel

the best low-light smartphone camera.

It's coming next month to Pixel 3

and our other Pixels as well.

- You might have noticed the second camera

on the front of the phone.

Let's see what it does.

- Are you advanced

take a selfie.

Here we go.

Wait.

- Move your head towards mine.

- Scoot over, scoot over.

- Sorry, sorry okay.

- My arm's not

long enough, guys.

- Try it again.

Get in, get in, get in.

- Boys, we gotta back

up just a little bit, back up.

- Back up, back up.

- Stay in the frame.

- I am.

- Stay in the frame.

Willow, just stay in the frame.

- Guess where I am.

Uh.

- Oh, oh did you see that!

- Move your arm,

we're not gonna fit.

- Don't get in it.

- We're not gonna both fit.

Just move your arm, move your arm!

- Ow, that's mean!

- Just move over!

- Hey, Mitch,

could you scootch in?

I'm trying to take a selfie.

- Oh wait, one sec.

- Oh.

- All right, three, two, one, smile!

- Pixel users tend to get drafted

as the official photographer

including for group selfies,

and we wanna help them

be great at their job, so

we added a second camera

on the front that captures

184% more of the scene

than iPhone XS.

Now you can fit everyone in the shot

without a selfie stick or

unusually long arms like mine.

Just zoom out.

The difference is striking.

You aren't just getting

more people in the frame,

you're getting more details, more scenery,

more of a story.

- For photos and selfies

with even more story,

we've got you covered.

We've evolved AR Stickers to

what we now call Playground

and built it into both the

front and rear cameras.

We've got lots of new

content and characters

including the Avengers in celebration

of Marvel Studio's 10-year anniversary.

These characters are rendered

to feel lifelike in the scene

and they even interact with each other.

Characters can now also

respond to your actions

and facial expressions.

They look like they're

really in the scene with you.

Playground is launching on

Pixel 3 and will be rolled out

to Pixel 1 and 2 soon with

more content on the way.

- And of course, Pixel 3's

camera is for so much more

than taking pictures.

Last year, we introduced Google Lens

which helps you do more with your camera

with what you see.

This year, we integrated Google Lens

directly into the Pixel 3 camera.

Point it at a take-out

menu and Lens will pull out

the phone number to call.

Point it at a movie poster

to click through to the URL.

Lens is now able to work instantly

in the camera and on-device

for some of the most common actions

even without a data connection.

This is only possible by

combining Pixel Visual Core

with our years of work in

Search and computer vision.

Being able to search the world around you

is the next logical step in organizing

the world's information

and making it more useful for people

and we've been doing

that in some fun new ways

like with style search in Lens.

So now, when your friend's wearing

a cool new pair of sunglasses

or you see some shoes you like

in a magazine, you can use

Lens to find them online

and browse similar styles.

It's one more way we're

integrating our AI,

software, and hardware to create

the best end-to-end camera experience.

- There are a lot of

brilliant new superpowers

coming in Pixel 3's camera,

but we didn't have time

to get through them all.

I'm sure you don't want to sit

through a two-hour keynote.

So here's a quick list of

some of the other features

you'll see in our demo area later.

- Photobooth mode

automatically snaps photos

with a smile or when

you make a funny face.

No shutter button needed.

- With Motion auto focus,

just tap on people,

puppies, or anything else

that won't hold still

and they'll stay in focus as

they move around the frame.

- We made a few enhancements

to Portrait mode.

You can edit the depth

of field in a portrait.

You can also change the

focal subject of the photo

or make the color pop.

- And one of the best aspects of Pixel 3

is free unlimited storage

at original quality.

You'll never have to worry about storing,

syncing, or finding your photos.

Pixel 3's camera is

the best end-to-end photography experience

ever on a smartphone.

We can't wait for you to try it.

- So what about when

you're not taking photos?

We designed Pixel 3 to

take things off your plate

so you can spend more

time enjoying the moment

and looking at the world instead

of looking at your phone.

As Rick mentioned earlier, our

new Google Assistant feature,

powered by Duplex technology,

is able to help users

with real-world tasks over the phone

like calling a restaurant to book a table.

Pixel phones will be the first to get

this Google Assistant

feature when it rolls out

city by city this month.

Next month.

One of these months.

Next month.

So stay tuned for details.

- And we're going even further to help you

with phone calls with our

new Call Screen feature.

Let's say you're at dinner with friends

or in a meeting at work

and a call comes in.

It could be something important

or it could be an offer for a free cruise.

When you get that call and you can't

or don't want to pick up, just

tap the Screen Call button

and your phone will answer for you

and ask who's calling and why.

As you can see here, the

conversation is transcribed

in real time on your screen.

You can decide whether to pick up,

send a quick reply, or

mark the call as spam.

You'll never have to talk

to another telemarketer.

This all happens on-device,

powered by Google's AI.

Call Screen launches today

with Pixel 3 in the US

and comes to the entire

Pixel family next month.

- And we all know what it's like

to be overwhelmed by notifications.

Sometimes we just wanna

disconnect entirely.

So we've developed a feature

we call Flip to Shush,

an easy gesture to minimize distractions.

Just turn your phone

upside down on the table

and your Pixel will take the hint

and mute sounds and notifications

so you can have a quiet

dinner with friends

or spend some time with your family.

And finally, Pixel 3 includes

our new Titan Security chip.

As Rick said earlier,

Titan is a big step forward

in how we safeguard our users' data

with on-device protection

for log-in credentials,

disk encryption, app

data, and the integrity

of the operating system.

- We have one last thing to show you.

What if your phone could provide

a totally different

experience when it's charging?

We're excited to introduce

the smartest wireless charger ever,

the new Pixel Stand.

As a wireless charger, Pixel

Stand is best-in-class.

It charges your Pixel 3 super

fast even through cases.

But Pixel Stand isn't just a charger.

It changes the way you

interact with your phone

thanks to the Google Assistant.

When you dock your phone, the UI adjusts

to be easily glanceable

from across the room.

You can control it with your voice

or the one-touch

suggestions on the display.

In the morning, your Pixel 3

is a more thoughtful alarm clock.

The screen will slowly brighten

before your alarm goes off

so you can make up more gently.

And with help from the Assistant,

it knows your morning

routine, the weather,

and can easily answer your questions,

similar to Google Home.

- Play your music on Pixel's

incredible front-firing stereo speakers

and the cover art is

displayed on the screen.

Pixel Stand also turns your Pixel 3

into a helpful component

of your thoughtful home.

You can easily control

your connected devices

around the house, and with Nest Hello,

you can see who's at the

door on your Pixel 3 screen.

When it's not busy with other tasks,

your Pixel 3 becomes a photo frame

that delights you with

automatically curated memories

from your Google Photos library,

again, similar to the

Google Home Hub experience

you saw earlier.

Pixel Stand transforms your Pixel 3

so you can get a more

visual, helpful experience

from your phone.

It's the best way to

wirelessly charge your Pixel

or any QI-compatible device.

Pixel 3 is available for pre-order now,

starting at $799, and Pixel Stand is $79.

Pixel 3 will arrive on October 18th

in the US through Verizon and unlocked

on the Google Store and Project Fi.

On November 1st, it will be

available in 12 more markets

including four new ones this year:

France, Ireland, Japan, and Taiwan.

- And we also have a

large selection of cases

and accessories available

from both Google and our partners.

Check them out on the Google Store today.

So that's the new Pixel 3.

It's designed from the inside out to be

the smartest, most helpful

device in your life.

It's a phone that can answer itself,

a camera that won't miss a shot,

and a helpful assistant

even when it's charging.

- Before Rick comes back

up, enjoy this short film,

shot entirely on Pixel 3, by

the amazing Terrence Malick.

- I heard about this frog.

It's a very tiny frog

but it's also very special.

You touch it,

your world can change forever.

Blue becomes red

and red becomes blue.

Nothing is ever quite the same you know.

- So there they are!

The newest members

of this year's Made by Google family.

We're taking an end-to-end

approach to consumer technology

that merges our most innovative AI

with intuitive software

and powerful hardware.

Made by Google devices

empower people to do more

with their day so they have

to do less with their tech

and they can focus on what matters most.

We've designed them from the inside out

to give you your own personal Google,

anticipating your needs,

taking things off your plate.

You got a first look at Titan Security

and how it's integrated

into our mobile hardware

for powerful protection in

a simplified experience.

And you've also seen how our approach

to digital well-being is woven

throughout the whole

portfolio from Call Screen

to Flip to Shush, Ambient

EQ, and Family Link,

we're taking our users'

well-being very seriously.

With Pixel Slate, we've

built a Chrome OS device

for the way you work and play today.

It's a powerful work station at the office

and it's a home theater

you can hold in your hands.

With Pixel 3, we've built the first phone

that can answer the phone.

And we've also taken the

world's best smartphone camera

and made it even better.

And with Google Home Hub, we've built

a radically helpful smart display

which lays the foundation

for the truly thoughtful home.

There's a whole lot more to these devices

and we're really excited for

you to see that for yourselves

in our demo area downstairs.

For those of you on the live

stream, please stick around

to see our products in

more in-depth demos online,

and also head over to our

fresh new online store

at this address behind

me for full details,

pricing, and availability.

Really appreciate you

being here with us today.

Thank you very much.

Have a great day.
