# Analysis of Sub-Titles in python using Jupyter Notebook
Analyzing sub-titles of speeches of Apple's iPhone and Google's Pixel launch event from 2018 and 2019.

I knew that the word **incredible** was one of the most used word in Apple's product launch speeches, I wanted to find out if Google also have any favorite word which is used most in their speeches.

The Jupyter Notebook is also available on Kaggle here at https://www.kaggle.com/ansari87/apple-google-product-launch-speech-analysis
